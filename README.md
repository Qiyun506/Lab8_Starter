# Lab 8 - Starter
1) we should put it "within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed"
   the reason is that the automated tests do not need to run manully, and we should test often and find the bug and fix it in time so we should not test all after the development is completed. When code is pushed the tests run automatically is what we want. Therefore the answer should be the first option.
2) yes E2E test will list the input data, actions and the output data for each feature or function
3) No. The reason is that message function is not an independent part, it may change with the interactions occur, and the result may vary from time to time.
4) Yes, we can write the function to check the length, if it is not exceed 80 it is true and else it is false. This standard is stactic and it will change along the environmental change
